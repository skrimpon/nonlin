# Leveraging Deep Learning Methods for Function Inverse Problems in Communication Systems

## Overview :cat:
Wireless communications over millimeter wave and terahertz frequency bands have attracted considerable attention for future cellular systems due to the abundantly available bandwidth. However, communications over these high frequencies are vulnerable to hardware imperfections of the radio frequency front-end (RFFE) devices. Specifically, the limitations such as noise figure, non-linear distortion, and phase offsets introduced by the radio equipment can significantly deteriorate the system performance. The RFFE distortion can be represented as a non-linear function where the input is the original signal and output is the distorted signal which generally results in information loss. We propose to make novel use of deep learning methods for function inverse problems, at the distortion mitigation phase of the communication systems.
